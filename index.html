                        John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, born on the 3rd of January 1892 and passing away on the 2nd of September 1973, was a distinguished English writer and philologist. He is acclaimed for his creation of the captivating high fantasy tales known as "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings." From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien held prestigious positions as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow at Pembroke College, both within the University of Oxford. Subsequently, he continued his academic career at the same institution, assuming the roles of Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College. He remained in these positions until his retirement in 1959. Notably, Tolkien maintained a close friendship with C. S. Lewis and was part of the informal literary discussion group known as The Inklings. His contributions to literature were acknowledged when Queen Elizabeth II appointed him a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on the 28th of March 1972. Following Tolkien's passing, his son Christopher undertook the task of publishing a series of works that drew from his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts. This literary endeavor, including "The Silmarillion," when combined with "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings," collectively constitutes a comprehensive collection of tales, poems, fictional histories, constructed languages, and literary essays set within the enchanting realm of Arda and, specifically, Middle-earth. During the period from 1951 to 1955, Tolkien coined the term "legendarium" to encompass the majority of these writings. While preceding authors had explored the realm of fantasy in their works, it was the immense success of "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" that directly spurred a resurgence of popularity in the genre. This achievement has led to Tolkien being widely recognized as the "founder" of contemporary high fantasy literature, or more precisely, high fantasy itself.
